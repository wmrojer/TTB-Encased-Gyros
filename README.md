# TTB-Encased-Gyros
Space Engineers Encased Gyros for Tiered Tech Blocks

Force and power is in line with default Gyros.
Every Tier up increase the force with 100%, the power requirement with 75% and component costs with 50%.
3x3 versions yield 27 times higher force (3*3*3) but only require 27*57% more power.

This is a bugfix for Dezzie9889's Tiered Encased Gyros

that in turn is based on Sandflakes's SF - Encased Gyroscopes
